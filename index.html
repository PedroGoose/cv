  <p><em>Website Developer & Ecommerce Manager</em></p>
  <p>My life in Website Development began as an apprentice administrator at FA-ST Ltd in Chesterfield UK. It began as when I started, I was the youngest and therefore knew about technology. This was not quite the case as I was a 25-year-old
    apprentice. The reason I was this old when I took my apprenticeship is simple, I'd spent my early years messing around, <a href="peter-the-student.html">failing university</a>, working on bars enjoying being young. However, one day I decided to start putting my life in order, this
    began with my <a href="political-foray.html">foray into politics</a>. Having had little but bar experience on my C.V, my options were limited, and I was unsure what approach to take. Then came the local elections where somehow at 24 I managed to get myself on the local council.
    This lead to me getting my apprenticeship and then with some great skills on with a till, the ability to get elected in local elections, and getting and administration apprenticeship the path for me was clear time to build my first Ecommerce shop
    for FA-ST......</p>
